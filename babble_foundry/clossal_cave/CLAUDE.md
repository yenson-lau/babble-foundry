# Clossal Cave Adventure by Crowther and Woods

Your goal is to try to score as many points as possible in the Clossal Cave Adventure within 20 turns.

The gameplay look works like this:

```python
from babble_foundry.clossal_cave.game import ClossalCaveGame

# Start the game
game = ClossalCaveGame()

for turn in in turns:
    # Gameplay loop
    current_desc = game.read()
    game.write(cmd)
```

- You should only use the methods `game.read()` and `game.write()`. **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT USE ANY OTHER METHODS.
- At the end of the game, report the score, your learnings, and your feedback on how you would do better next time. Write this into CLAUDE.md.
- Use the `scratchpad.txt` to keep track of anything useful for you during gameplay
